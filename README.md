Recharge InVision App with additional features

## What?

I'm a UI designer and I use InVision App a lot. InVision App is a great tool for making prototypes but there are some missing useful features in its UI. This project contains several hacks that will save my (and your) time in InVision App.

## The Hacks

### Actions

- Collapse all sections
- Expand all sections
- Sort hotspot templates (only display) (coming soon)

### UI Fixes

- Always displayed section tools (switchable) (coming soon)
- Always displayed project-sync (switchable) (coming soon)
- No transition (switchable) (coming soon)
- Wider filename label (coming soon)
- Wider section rename text input (coming soon)

## Installation

Use tampermonkey
