Recharge InVision App with additional features

## What?

I'm a UI designer and I use InVision App a lot. InVision App is a great tool for making prototypes but there are some missing useful features in its UI. This project contains several hacks that will save my (and might be your) time in InVision App.

## Caution

This plugin might break your InVision project. Use it at your own risk. But, I've been using it on a big InVision project (500+ screens, 60+ hotspot templates, 35+ screen groups) without any problem üòÉ.

## The Hacks

### Actions

- Screen List
    - Collapse all sections
    - Expand all sections
- Build Mode
    - Sort hotspot templates (Top Dropdown) (display only, sorted list won't be saved)

### UI Fixes

- General
    - No transition (switchable) _(coming soon)_
- Screen List
    - Always displayed file name
    - Always displayed date
    - Wider divider label input 
    - Always displayed section tools (switchable) _(coming soon)_
    - Always displayed project-sync (switchable) _(coming soon)_
    - Wider filename label _(coming soon)_
- Preview Mode
    - Download current image _(coming soon)_
- Build Mode
    - No ellipses
